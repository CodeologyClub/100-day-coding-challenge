Alien Alphabet

Suppose you have a dictionary of an alien language which
lists words in some sorted lexicographical ordering. For
example, given the following list of words:

`[baa abcd abca cab cad]`

You can conclude the ordering of the alphabet is

`b < d < a < c`

Write a program to determine the lexicographical
ordering for any input list.

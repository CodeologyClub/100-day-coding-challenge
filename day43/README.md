Let's rewrite the heap I did in day 38 and make it better.
And also make it a max heap.

## Code

[Python](./maxHeap.py)

## Follow-up

I was inspired to re-write the MinHeap into a MaxHeap and make the code
cleaner due to this blog post:

http://www.techiedelight.com/min-heap-max-heap-implementation-c/

It has a pretty good looking implementation in C++.

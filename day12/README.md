Question of the day: https://www.careercup.com/question?id=5672334801240064

You are tasked with defining and implementing a function. As input,
you are given an `n` by `m` matrix. `x` may appear any number of
times in a matrix. Your function should modify the matrix such that
any row and column where `x` originally appears are completely over-
written with `x`.

For example:

```
-----
-----
---x-
x----
-----
```

turns into:

x--x-
x--x-
xxxxx
xxxxx
x--x-
